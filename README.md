# Assignment-02-Building-Your-Website
IMD1005 assignement 02 - building your website

Name: kenny kutshina

Student number: 101383837

Site Purpose:

This website was created for my client Marcus Hayes who recently opened a cafe. The main purpose is to communicate a welcoming atmostphere, attract teens and young adults and properly reflect the cafe's environment. The overral design places emphasis on warmth and simplicity which aligns with the clients goals from assignement 1.

Pages:

1. home, which is the landing page that introduces the cafe and visually communicates the atmoshere
2. about, which is the page that describes what the cafe is all about and a little bit of who Marcus Hayes is
3. contact, which is a page for asking questions or to contact the cafe

Design Changes:

While I was coding I made a couple changes due to difficulty level and efficiency. Some designs from Figma were hard and too advanced to code. The exact images used in Figma werent possible to find either. I also changed the amount of section or how much information was in sections to make the website more simple. I used a colors a lot more to really communicate a warm atmosphere. Overall the layout was made simpler in order to code, but the core concepts of atmosphere and communicating with images stayed consitent with the original design

AI Usage:

Tool Used: ChatGPT

How it was used: I used it to code certain elements in the  website, like getting symbols, i clarified inside the code which parts were made with ai, but overrall it was used for simple but advanced coding, structuring and layout

Text Content: All of the texts used werent mine, i used the same text figma used in the original ai website, i also used LOREM IPSUM

But with ai i learned new ways to code and get the cool results i want so it was more of a learning tool rather than just copy pasting things.
