#My client is Marcus hayes, he is looking for a website that can communicate a nice atmopshere. The sites purpose will be to attract teens and young adults to his newly built cafe, using design which communicate warmth
#A couple design changes were made. Alot of design elements were hard to code. I didnt have the exact images that figma used either. All in all, i made changes to make the coding process easier. But most elements are the same. The most obvious change is that there is less images, more colours the typography is more basic, and really just a more simple website design.
#There was AI usage for codes, i mentioned all of it in comments inside the coding files, the text used are also not mine, most are from Figma ai but other are also LOREM IPSUM generated. The pisture used are also not mine ill provide a link for all pictures
